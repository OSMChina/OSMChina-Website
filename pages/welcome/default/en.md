Hello, {{ mapper.displayName }}

Welcome to the world of OpenStreetMap, and congratulations on completing your first edit.

The world is vast, from the oceans and mountains on a planetary scale to the alleyways and convenience stores near your home. When these are recorded, they become guideposts for explorers. From the ancient "Kunyu Wanguo Quantu" to today’s detailed digital maps, using maps has become more and more convenient.

OpenStreetMap is an open platform. You are free to creatively use this geographic data, which is provided by volunteers as open-source.

Your first edit might be located at a school, in a neighborhood, along a railway, or anywhere that interests you. In any case, please maintain your enthusiasm, and we hope you will enjoy sharing your unique knowledge of your local area.

We wish you enjoy the process and have fun!
